Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a 
gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average 
density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named 
after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol represents the god's sickle.</p>

Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). 
Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and 
liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its 
upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to 
Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times 
that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of 
Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features 
can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter, 
but not as high as those on Neptune. In January 2019, astronomers reported that a day on the planet 
Saturn has been determined to be10h 33m 38s + 1m 52s- 1m 19s?, based on studies of the planet's 
C Ring.</p>

The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, 
with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 
are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest 
moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less 
massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>
