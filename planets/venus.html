Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can 
be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so 
never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a 
bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, 
it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System and does so in the 
opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east). Venus does 
not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar System.</p>

Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, 
mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. 
It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. 
The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or 
roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus has by far the hottest surface of any 
planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K, 464 C, 867 F, even though Mercury is 
closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, 
preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past, 
but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The water 
has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the 
solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field. Venus' surface is a dry desertscape 
interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.</p>
<p align="justify">
As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as 
records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration 
for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its 
motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.</p>
<p align="justify">
Due to its proximity to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was 
the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully 
landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus' thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible 
light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans 
have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus' hostile surface 
conditions.</p>
<p align="justify">
The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation, and in recent years has received 
active research. Following a 2019 observation that the light absorbance of the upper cloud layers was 
consistent with the presence of microorganisms, a September 2020 article in Nature Astronomy 
announced the detection of phosphine gas, a biomarker, in concentrations higher than can be explained by an
y known abiotic source. However, doubts have been cast on these observations due to the failure to 
detect phosphine at other wavelengths and data-processing issues.</p>
