A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by
its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonucleasr fusion, and – acconding to the International 
Astronomical Union but not all planetary scientists – has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.</p>

The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. 
Apart from Earth itself, five planets in the Solar System are often visible to the naked eye. 
These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. 
As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of 
disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution 
defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many 
objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies 
discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the current definition, some celestial bodies, 
such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), 
and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the 
scientific community, are no longer viewed as planets under the current definition of planet.</p>

The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. 
Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times,
it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic 
astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. About the same time, by careful analysis of 
pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' 
orbits were elliptical rather than circular. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, 
like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, 
and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, 
close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such 
as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.</p>

Planets in the Solar System are divided into two main types: large low-density giant planets, 
and smaller rocky terrestrials. There are eight planets in the Solar System according to the 
IAU definition. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials,
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites.</p>

Several thousands of planets around other stars ("extrasolar planets" or "exoplanets") 
have been discovered in the Milky Way. As of 1 October 2020, 4,354 known extrasolar planets in 
3,218 planetary systems (including 712 multiple planetary systems), ranging in size from just above the size
of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter have been discovered, out of which more than 
100 planets are the same size as Earth, nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as 
Earth from the Sun, i.e. in the circumstellar habitable zone. On December 20, 2011, the Kepler Space 
Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Kepler-20e and 
Kepler-20f, orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20. A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, 
estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way. Around one in five 
Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable  zone.</p>
